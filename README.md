ProGuin is a productivity system inspired by the image of a penguin steadily moving 
toward a mountain — slow, consistent, and unstoppable.

This is not just a todo-list app.

ProGuin is a growing experiment that combines ideas from multiple productivity philosophies and books, 
starting from a simple CLI-based foundation and evolving step by step.

The goal is to build a system that:
- encourages consistency over motivation
- rewards completion, not planning
- works across CLI, desktop, and mobile in the future

This repository represents the beginning.

## Philosophy
- Discipline over motivation
- Do hard work first, reward later
- Time-bound focus
- Simple daily structure

## What ProGuin is NOT
- Not a fancy todo app
- Not a motivational quote generator
- Not overwhelming

## Current Features
- Task-based daily planning
- Time-bound tasks
- Rewards for completion
- Persistent data (JSON)

## Roadmap
- Interactive CLI menu
- Focus timers
- Auto-run daily schedule
- Desktop/mobile versions (future)

## Getting Started
```bash
python app.py
