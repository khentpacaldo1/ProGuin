## About The Project

ProGuin is a productivity system.

This is not just a todo-list app. ProGuin is a growing experiment that combines ideas from multiple productivity philosophies and books, starting from a simple CLI-based foundation and evolving step by step.

The goal is to build a system that:

-   Encourages consistency over motivation
-   Rewards completion, not planning
-   Works across CLI, desktop, and mobile in the future

This repository represents the beginning.
