# ProGuien 🐧

ProGuien is a productivity system inspired by the image of a penguin steadily moving 
toward a mountain — slow, consistent, and unstoppable.

This is not just a todo-list app.

ProGuien is a growing experiment that combines ideas from multiple productivity philosophies and books, 
starting from a simple CLI-basedfoundation and evolving step by step.

The goal is to build a system that:
- encourages consistency over motivation
- rewards completion, not planning
- works across CLI, desktop, and mobile in the future

This repository represents the beginning.
