# Contributing to ProGuin

Thank you for your interest in contributing! 

This project values simple, disciplined progress. Contributions don’t need to be big to be valuable—small, focused improvements are encouraged.

This guide is written for first-time open‑source contributors and assumes little or no prior GitHub experience.

## 4. Make your changes
Keep changes small and focused.
If you are unsure, it's okey to ask questions in the issue or PR.
